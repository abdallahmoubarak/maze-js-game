# maze-js-game - additional features

- Create different levels in the game. One level contains a timer. The user now has a limited time (1 min max) to finish the game.</br>
- Ask the user for his/her username using the prompt() function and greet the user once he or she starts the mission. Add an option to save the score in the local storage so whenever an already existing account is entered, the score is automatically loaded.
